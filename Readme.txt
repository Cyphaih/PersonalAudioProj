It is a pretty simple project you only have mouse and audio input.

Left click will either open the different modules or specifically decrease the higher or lower range settings in the exercise module.
Right click closes the modules and decreases the mentioned settings in the exercise module.
Mic input is necessary for the modules and in the exercise module you have to match your pitch to the shown pitch on screen 
	(you can open the Pitch module to help you)
You can drag the window with the LMB and close the application with the X button

The project includes a module for:

AudioSpectrum, this just shows a logarithmic graph of the audioSpectrum, fun to look at

Pitch, this shows you the pitch determined from the mic input and helps with the exercise

Exercise, this shows you the pitch you have to match, you can adjust the range with the buttons to the right, 
	with the left one being the lower limit and the right one the upper Limit





Ilyas C note

I made this project because I wanted this kind of exercise and knowledge.
